# PrEP-STI 

This project contains the code for an Individual-based, site-specific simulator of STI transmission. The project is being conducted at [_The Kirby Institute_](https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/), UNSW Sydney. It is currently under development and will initially be used to investigate the impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention on STI incidence and prevalence in Australian gay and bisexual men. The project is funded by NSW Health via Prevention Research Support Program (PRSP) funding.
